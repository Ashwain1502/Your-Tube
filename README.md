I developed a dynamic web platform for video streaming using React.js, Material UI, Tailwind CSS, and the YouTube V3 API. Integrated components like trending videos, channel info, and search functionality, spanning diverse content categories. Leveraged YouTube V3 API for efficient data retrieval, ensuring seamless user experience across devices with responsive design.

2. Extract and move to the folder.
3. Run the command 'npm install' or 'npm i' to install node modules
4. File your youtube v3 api key in .env file
5. Run the command 'npm start' to start the application
